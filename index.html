          <p>Walking through my neighborhood, one of the patterns that I notice all the time is the vast amount of churches within just a few blocks from each other...</p>
          <p>Many of these churches were established during times of migration, especially in the 1980s and 1990s, when Crown Heights had a large amount of Caribbean immigrants arrive...</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the large amount of churches right next to each other, and within a three-block radius in my neighborhood is not a coincidence, it is a part of the history of migration...</p>
