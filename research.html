    <h2>Background Information</h2>
    <p>
      Walking through my neighborhood, one thing I’ve always noticed but never really thought about is the number of churches packed into just a few blocks. On my way to the train, I pass at least three, and two of them are right next to each other. If I take a different route, I see even more. But until now, I’ve never actually stopped to count them or pay attention to their names. It makes me wonder, why are there so many churches in such a small area? Is it because of the people who live here? Does it have something to do with the economy?

            Another thing that stands out is how different these churches look. Some are big, traditional buildings with steeples and beautiful stained glass, while others look more like stores or small community spaces from afar, they just blend in with the city. I want to look at how long they’ve been around and how they’ve changed over the years. I’m also curious about their role in the neighborhood today, I have seen some of the churches have food pantries or small gardens where they grow food for people in need, and children's events. Others are quieter, only really active on Sundays.

                Brooklyn has been known as the "Borough of Churches" because of how many churches there are but the amount of churches in the Crown Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant areas that are directly right next to each other is very interesting and something that a lot of people do not pay too much attention to, not even the residents of the neighborhoods. Many of these churches were established during times of migration, especially in the 1980s and 1990s, when Crown Heights had a large amount of Caribbean immigrants arrive. The people who came here at that time (and more recently as well) wanted to create a safe space where they could worship comfortably with other people of their same culture as well as better the neighborhood. An example of this is Bishop Irving Pollard, who is originally from Guayana and runs the St. Paul Seventh Day Apostolic Spiritual Baptist Church on Utica Ave, says, “Years ago, this neighborhood was a very rundown neighborhood. It had a lot of young people on drugs ... we feel it was best to bring the church into this community so we could help those that were unfortunate. To help them and to bring them into the right way” (NY City News Service).

            Aside from being places to practice your religion, some of these churches are also very involved with the community and are some sort of community center. They provide food drives and social events. For example, some churches have food pantries or give free meals and even have their own community garden, they pay attention to the community and recognize that lack of food or resources is a real issue for many families in this area. The Bed-Stuy Campaign Against Hunger (BSCAH) is an essential community organization whose goal is to fight food insecurity in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area. It was founded in 2001 and it has become one of the largest food pantries in New York City, providing access to food for thousands of families in need, they offer free meals and groceries, as well as educational programs about healthier eating habits and increasing awareness about nutrition in order to help locals. They partner with local churches (including churches around me), schools, and other community centers because they want to make sure it reaches those who need it most.

        Creating new establishments due to migration isn’t something recent, history shows that churches have been built by immigrant communities who want to be in a familiar space that they feel comfortable in amongst their people. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Brooklyn had a wave of European immigrants (Italian, Irish, and Jewish) who built churches and synagogues so that the people coming in had a safe space to practice their faith. Later, as more people migrated, some of these places started being used to serve Black and Caribbean communities, who came in with their own traditions.

            In conclusion, the large amount of churches right next to each other, and within a three-block radius in my neighborhood is not a coincidence, it is a part of the history of migration to this neighborhood and a part of community-building, these churches aren’t just places of worship; they are support systems. Through food pantries, community events, or just providing a familiar place for immigrants to connect with others who share their traditions, they play an important role in shaping the neighborhood.
