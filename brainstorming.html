        <h2>Initial Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Walking through my neighborhood, one of the patterns that I notice all the time is the vast amount of churches within just a few blocks from each other. On my everyday commute to the train station, there are three churches, and two of them are directly next to each other. I know there are more churches when I walk on the opposite side of the train station, so that is something that I want to explore: how many churches are around my area? I have seen them before, but I never paid attention to the names or how many there are.</p>

        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <p>Something that I have seen is that their architecture varies; some look like small businesses or buildings, while others are big, noticeable churches. Something that I’m curious about is what led to so many churches within a small area. Is it because of economic reasons? Is it because of the people that live in this neighborhood?</p>

            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 5px;">Universal Church of God in Christ</p>
          </div>
        <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
        <p>Some churches have food pantries, and others have their own garden where they harvest different produce for the people in the neighborhood. Another aspect I want to look into is the role these churches play in the community, aside from being a place of worship and support. Some churches seem to be more involved with the community by offering services like food pantries, some have gardens where they grow food for everyone in the community (not only the people who go to their church) and provide people with access to flu shots.</p>

          </div>
        <h2>Church Activity Levels</h2>
        <p>I’ve also noticed that some churches seem more active than others, with people coming in and out, and hosting those community events, while others seem quiet and empty most of the time.</p>
